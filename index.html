            <figcaption>Jessica Lange, as Dwan in MGM's 1976 remake of King Kong, 
                is lifted and held by a giant electrohydraulic hand powerful enough 
                to easily crush her. Some clever engineering was employed to ensure 
                that couldn't happen.</figcaption>

                <p>"Be present. I would encourage you with all my heart just to be present. 
                    Be present and open to the moment that is unfolding before you. 
                    Because, ultimately, your life is made up of moments. 
                    So don't miss them by being lost in the past or anticipating the future."</p>
